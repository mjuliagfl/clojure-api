# clojure-api

My first API in Clojure

## How to run the application

First, you need to clone this repository.

I provided a docker-compose file to build and run a local container with the app and its dependencies.

### Using Docker

Once you cloned the repository, enter the root folder and run:

`docker-compose up -d`


Then, verify if the container is running with:

`docker ps`

Once the container is running, the application is running locally on port 8090 and you will be able to make requests.
